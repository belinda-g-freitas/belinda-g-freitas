## ðŸ¤¡ Fun fact about me
I wanted to learn software engineering after high school because I loved and still love playing video games, so I hoped that I could make my own games (with my own crazy features); but at the end I figured out that developing video games would tire my eyes twice (developping and then playing), and I probably won't be so excited to play my own games since I would have gotten accustomed to them during the dev proccess. So, at the end I decided to be mobile dev because it is my sencond favorite topic.
